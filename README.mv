# GoogleReaderAPI-iOS

This is a project I'm open-sourcing while developing a news reader
app that uses Google Reader API as database storage. This is heavily
inspired by the Pyrfeed Python library. Google still has not released
any documented and public API for Reader, so everything here has to be
intended as NOT OFFICIAL and UNDOCUMENTED.

This is an ALPHA stage.

## Features v0.1

* Low API methods
